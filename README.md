#🌤️ WeatherX – Smart Weather Dashboard

`WeatherX is a web application that analyzes historical weather data, shows current conditions, and recommends nearby places and activities that match the current weather.

 What it does
- Analyzes the last 30 days of weather using the Open-Meteo API.

- Displays current weather: temperature, humidity, wind – via wttr.in.
- Visualizes data:
-Temperature distribution
-Temp ↔ Humidity correlation
-Hourly patterns (average & max)
- Suggests places to go nearby, tailored to current weather (restaurants, parks, malls, etc.).
- Integrates with Geoapify Places API.


 How it works:
1.The user inputs a city + country.
2.The app geocodes the location using Geoapify
3.It fetches weather data and processes it using pandas.
4.Charts are built using Seaborn and Plotly.
5.Based on current temp, it filters relevant places and displays them as cards.


 Development Highlights:
State management handled with Streamlit logic (no heavy backend).
Designed for clarity and responsiveness with minimal UI elements
Used API chaining and conditional filtering to provide personalized recommendations.
